http://neo4j.com[Neo4j] GraphGists are an easy way to create and share documents containing not just prose, structure 
and pictures but most importantly **example graph models and use-cases** expressed in Neo4j's query language http://docs.neo4j.org/refcard/2.1/[Cypher].

These documents are written in AsciiDoc -- the simple, textual markup language -- and rendered in your browser as rich and interactive web pages that you 
can quickly evolve from describing simple howtos or questions to providing an extensive use-case specification.

To see the expressive power of this approach, here are some winners of our past community competitions:

. **Log into** your GitHub account
. **Choose** one of the examples listed above, click the green **page source** button.
. **Fork** the original GraphGist into your own account and **start to edit** the prose, images, setup and use-case Cypher queries.
. **Paste** the Github Gist URL into the top right URL box of any GraphGist page and hit enter; your Gist will be loaded and rendered immediately.

=== Setup a Graph to show you and your Likes

//setup
[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (digitalcurrency:Knowledge{name:'Digital currency'})
CREATE (electronicmoney:Knowledge{name:'Electronic money'})
CREATE (moneylaundering:Knowledge{name:'Money laundering'})
CREATE (taxation:Knowledge{name:'Taxation'})
CREATE (financialservices:Knowledge{name:'Financial Services'})
RETURN digitalcurrency, electronicmoney, moneylaundering, taxation, financialservices
----

And render as a graph.

//graph

=== Now query the graph to show all the things you like

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (david:Person{name:'Dave Petrocelli'})
CREATE (fcen:Experience{name:'Manager of Latin America Operations for Financial Crimes Enforcement Network'})
CREATE (citi:Experience{name:'Staff Attorney at Citigroup, Commercial Banking Division'})
CREATE (david)-[:HAS_EXP]->(fcen)
CREATE (david)-[:HAS_EXP]->(citi)
CREATE (fcen)-[:IS_SIMILAR{degree:19}]->(digitalcurrency)
CREATE (fcen)-[:IS_SIMILAR{degree:15}]->(moneylaundering)
CREATE (citi)-[:IS_SIMILAR{degree:23}]->(financialservices)
----

And render as a graph.

//graph
